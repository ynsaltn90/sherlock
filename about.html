        <h2>BIO</h2>
        <p>
          The British fictional detective created by Arthur Conan Doyle was born on January 6, 1854 in London. His first story, The Red File, was published in the newspaper in 1887. Sherlock Holmes is perhaps the most famous of the detective heroes. He is famous for coding events through observation. The use of deduction is very good, researchers take care to form a whole between the answers to the questions asked; In addition, the information obtained as a result of his own laboratory research, applies individual devices and reaches results from cigarette butts, handwritings, footprints, and all kinds of information scraps. While creating the character of Holmes, author Doyle took Professor Joseph Bell, one of the famous doctors of the time, as an example. Bell used the observing patients they lived through in the Sherlock Holmes adventures to have relevant information, and this method was taught to medical educators. Holmes is not interested in anything that is not related to his job, he follows the high society news for his service, but Dr. Not what Watson teaches Holmes' policy knowledge is zero out of ten. He was even able to exaggerate on this subject and say, "If knowing that the Earth revolves around the Sun does not help me, why should I keep this printer in my head".
